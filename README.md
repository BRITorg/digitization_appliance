# BRIT Digitizaton Appliance

The BRIT Digitization Appliance is a suite of tools used to accellerate the process of capturing and managing specimen images and metadata in a digitization workflow.

The client application runs on an imaging station and monitors the creation of images and analyzes the files to extract barcode values and to capture relevant metadata.

The server application syncronizes images and metadata with one or more imaging station and compiles and analyzes imaging metrics.
